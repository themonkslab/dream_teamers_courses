# Exercise 1

Imagine You are building a simple quiz application and need to keep track of the user's score.
Write a Dart program called quizScore that simulates a quiz and calculates the user's score.

Requirements:

- The program should have two int variables called correctAnswers and totalQuestions, which represent the number of questions the user answered correctly and the total number of questions in the quiz, respectively.
- The user's score should be calculated as a double variable called score, which is equal to the percentage of questions the user answered correctly.
- The correctAnswers variable should be set using the var keyword.
- The totalQuestions variable should be set using the final keyword.
- The score variable should be set using the const keyword.
- The program should print out the user's score in a user-friendly format, such as "You answered XX out of XX questions correctly, for a score of XX%."

Explain why the use of each type of variable.
