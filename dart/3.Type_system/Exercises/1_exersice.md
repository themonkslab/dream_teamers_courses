# Exercise 1

Imagine You are building a simple quiz application and need to keep track of the user's score.
Write a Dart program called quizScore that simulates a quiz and calculates that score.

Requirements:

- The program should have two variables called correctAnswers and totalQuestions, which represent the number of questions the user answered correctly and the total number of questions in the quiz, respectively.
- The user's score should be calculated as a variable called score, which is equal to the percentage of questions the user answered correctly.
- Choose either final, var, or const to declare the variables based on the context and their intended usage.
- The program should print out the user's score in a user-friendly format, such as "You answered XX out of XX questions correctly, for a score of XX%."

Explain why the use of each type of variable.
