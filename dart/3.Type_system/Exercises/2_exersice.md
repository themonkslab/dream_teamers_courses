# Exercise 2

You are building a simple payment processing application and need to calculate the total cost of an order.
Write a Dart program called calculateOrder that calculates that cost.

Requirements:

- The program should have four variables called itemPrice, taxRate, quantity and totalCost, which represent the price of the item being ordered, the tax rate, the quantity of items being ordered and the total cost of the order respectively.
- Choose either final, var, or const to declare the variables based on the context and their intended usage.
- The itemPrice variable should be initialized to a value of 29.99.
- The taxRate variable should be initialized to a value of 0.07.
- The quantity variable should be initialized to a value of 2.
- The totalCost variable should be initialized to a value calculated as itemPrice \* quantity \* (1 + taxRate).
- The program should print out the total cost of the order in a user-friendly format, such as "The total cost of your order is $XX.XX for Y items."
