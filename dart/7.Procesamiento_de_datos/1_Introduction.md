# Introduction

In this section, __we are going to__ use Dart to __process data__ coming from a `.csv` file, which is a _comma-separated values_ text file that allows us to represent data usually produced from a spreadsheet. I will provide an example for us to work on, although creating your own files from spreadsheets is very simple, just by exporting your document as a `.csv`.

We will attempt to parse command-line arguments, read the file line by line, process it, and more!
