# Exercise 2

## Context

You are a developer at a company that organizes dart tournaments. The company has just received a large dataset containing information about the players, teams, and matches. Your task is to write a program that can analyze the dataset and provide insights about the tournament.

## Requirements

The dataset is in the form of three separate CSV files:

- `2_players.csv` - contains information about each player, including their name, age, and skill level.
- `2_teams.csv` - contains information about each team, including their name, captain's name, and the names of the players in the team.
- `2_matches.csv` - contains information about each match, including the names of the two teams that played, the date of the match, and the scores.

Your program should perform the following tasks:

- Load the data from the CSV files into appropriate data structures (lists, sets, maps, etc.).
- Calculate the average age of all the players.
- Find the team with the most number of wins and print their name and the number of wins.
- Calculate the total number of goals scored in all matches.

## Note

As you can see there are other data in the .csv files that you could use to get new and better conclusions. In the exercise we only propose some of them but you know... try new things, new methods, try to solve things that you can't even imagine how to do them. That's the best way to learn!
