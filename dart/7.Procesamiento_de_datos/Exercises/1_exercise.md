# Exercise 1

## Context

You are working as a data analyst for a small startup that helps local farmers sell their products directly to consumers. Your job is to analyze the data to help the farmers make informed decisions about what crops to grow and when to harvest them.

## Requirements

Your task is to create a program that can help the farmers analyze their sales data from the previous year. The program should read in a CSV file (`1_data.csv`)that contains information about each sale, including the date, the type of product sold, the quantity sold, and the price per unit.

Your program should then do the following:

- Calculate the total revenue generated by each type of product.
- Calculate the total quantity sold of each type of product.
- Calculate the average price per unit of each type of product.
- Determine the top-selling products by revenue, quantity, and average price.
