# Hierarchies

I will try to tell you about it in a simple way because there are still some things that we did not see; I hope that by reading it calmly you will understand. If not, you can always join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/vpPVf7guPC)  and ask questions until you understand! ðŸ¤“

The graphic from the [documentation on null safety in Dart](https://dart.dev/null-safety/understanding-null-safety), shows what the type hierarchy was like before _null safety_ was included:

![Type hierarchy before null safety](4.1_jerarquias_antes_de_null_safety.png)

Here we can see a simplification where all types were childs of the `Object` type (you didn't see `Iterable` and `num` yet but basically they are parents of `List` and, `double` and `int` as seen in the graphic). Underneath it all, there was the `Null` type.

But what does it mean that they are parents and childs? We will see inheritance soon, but simply __childs have the possibility to do what their parent does__.

Suppose we meet Superman with his son and Batman with his son: Superman's son inherits the ability to fly, shoot lightning with his eyes and his marked reluctance to kryptonite. While Batman's son inherits only fortunes! ðŸ¤£

__The set of operations that are allowed in some expressions are defined by their type.__ I repeat because this is very important: The set of operations that are allowed in some expressions are defined by their type. If the type is a `List`, we can call `.add()` as we already saw, or if it is `int` we can use the `+`, but the `null value`, does not have any of those methods. So why can we print it? Because of the only three methods it has, one is `toString()`, which allows it to be displayed as if it were a text string.

If we were to allow the null value to move through types other than its own, it will fail. And this is __the key to all _null safety_: every failure comes from trying to access a method or property that `null` does not contain.__

How did _null safety_ to fix this ? By changing the hierarchy.

## New hierarchy since _null safety_

__Now the `Null` _type_ exists but is no longer a child of all previous types__.

![New hierarchy since _null safety_](4.2_jerarquias_despues_de_null_safety.png)

And since it is no longer a child or subtype, the `Null` class allows a `null` value and __the rest of the types are non-nullable by default,__ explaining what we saw before.

Thus, a value can flow from being null to non-null according to the _static check_ or as we define it explicitly. In this way, we ensure forever and ever, never ever, to have errors due to null values! ðŸ˜… Well, it is not quite true since we will have them but at least we will have had from our dear Dart, all the necessary help so that this could have been avoided! ðŸ˜‚

## The previous problem

Remember the exercise? Why does it print the null value? And why can you use the `toUpperCase()` method on a `String?`?

```dart
void main() {
  const hardware = <String?>['Mouse', 'Keyboard', null];
  for (var hardwarePiece in hardware) {
    print(hardwarePiece?.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```

Here we already answered half in the previous paragraphs: it prints the null value because it does have within its only three methods, one called `toString()` that allows us to pass to text string its value and therefore print it.

In the other half, why does it allow us to access the `toUpperCase()` method? Dart made the nullable type, in this case the `String?`, a parent of the `String` and `Null` types so that it can receive both forms. In our example, the _static check_ knows that the value is a `String` and that is what the parent receives so it can apply its methods, in this case the `toUpperCase()`.

In this way, the hierarchy would be something like this, having underneath all, a class `Never` that we will not see for now and allows to stop the execution of the application and to throw an exception.
