# Expressions and statements

We have seen these terms throughout this long introduction but what do they refer to? __A _statement_ is a command: it is something we tell the computer to do__. We already know that simple statements in Dart end with a _semicolon_ and you have already seen it several times with `print('something');`.

In addition to these simple statements, we will find more complex ones that do not end with the _terminator_ or _semicolon_.

__The _expressions___ on the other hand, __don't do something, they are something__. An expression is a value or is something that can be calculated as a value.

## ðŸ’ª Expressions or Statements?

__Requirement__: Look at the following list and write down next to it whether you think they are _expressions_ or _statements_.

1. `print('something');`
2. `42`
3. `'What a nice Dart course'`
4. `true`
5. `3 > 2`
6. `3++`
7. `'Coffee' != 'Milk'`
8. `int myVar = 4;`
9. `null`
10. `return null;`
