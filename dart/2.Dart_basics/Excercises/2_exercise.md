# Exercise 2

Declare two integer variables called x and y and initialize them with any values. Then, use asserts to make sure that x is greater than y, and print the message "Assertion passed" if the assertion is true, or "Assertion failed" if the assertion is false.

## Enable asserts

It must be noted that if you want to use assert then you have to enable it while execution as it can only be used in the development mode and not in production mode. If it is not enabled then it will be simply be ignored while execution.

Enable the assert while executing a dart file via cmd as:

dart --enable-asserts file_name.dart
