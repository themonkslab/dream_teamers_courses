# Exercise 3

Declare two integer variables called `a` and `b` and initialize them with any values. Then, use logical operators to print the message "Both a and b are even" if both `a` and `b` are even, "Either a or b is odd" if either `a` or `b` is odd, and "Neither a nor b is even" if neither `a` nor `b` is even.
