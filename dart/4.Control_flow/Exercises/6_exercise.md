# Exercise 6

You are working on a program for a small grocery store that sells fruits. The program needs to calculate the total cost of the fruits purchased by a customer. The store only sells apples, oranges, and bananas, and each fruit has a different price per unit.

## Requirements

- Define an enumeration called `FruitType` with three values: apple, orange, and banana.
- Define a variable called `fruit` that represents the type of fruit being purchased. The variable should be initialized with a value of either apple, orange, or banana.
- Define a variable called `quantity` that represents the number of units of the fruit being purchased. The variable should be initialized with a positive integer value.
- Use a switch statement to determine the price per unit of the fruit based on the value of the fruit variable. The price per unit for each fruit is as follows:
Apples cost \$0.50 per unit
Oranges cost \$0.75 per unit
Bananas cost \$0.30 per unit

Calculate the total cost of the fruit purchase by multiplying the price per unit by the quantity and then adding up the cost for each fruit.
Print out the total cost of the fruit purchase.
