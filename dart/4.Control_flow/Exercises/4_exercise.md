# Exercise 4

## Print Multiplication Table

Write a Dart program that prints the multiplication table for the numbers 1 through 10. The output should be formatted as follows:

1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
...
10 x 8 = 80
10 x 9 = 90
10 x 10 = 100

Hint: you should use two `for` one inside the other.
