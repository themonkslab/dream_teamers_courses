# Dart and VSCode medium level

You have already gone through a lot of hours of reading, exercising and learning. You have deeply learned the first basics of the language and you can already notice that you are outgrowing Dartpad.

It's time to move on to the second part of this course where we will learn how to handle VSCode closer to how we do when we work with it and we will do the same with Dart.

This is what we will work on:

- Creating, running and debugging apps.
- Components of a project.
- Packages, libraries, lints.
- Introduction to tests.
- And for a change... much more!

From the beginning we tried to make you think every line of code from back to front. Now it's time to force us into that process by using more complex tests and tools!

Enjoy, it's getting nicer and nicer!
