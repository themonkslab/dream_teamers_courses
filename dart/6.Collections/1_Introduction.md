# Introduction

A _collection_ is a group of values that go together. In this section we are going to learn about:

- Collection types: _lists_, _sets_ and _maps_.
- How to use them.
- Typical operations.
- _Type system_ and _Type inference_ in collections.
- _Collection-if_, _collection-for_, _spreads_.

Collections are everywhere, so I hope you find this chapter very useful.
