# Exercise 1

## Context

You are working for a coffee shop that has several locations in different cities. Your boss has asked you to help them create a system that will keep track of the coffee shop's inventory across all locations. They have provided you with a list of all the different types of coffee, as well as a list of each location and the amount of each coffee they currently have in stock.

## Requirements

Using loops, if statements, and data structures (lists, sets, and maps), you will need to create a program that:

- Displays a list of all the different types of coffee the coffee shop offers.
- Allows the user to select a coffee from the list.
- Displays the amount of that coffee currently in stock across all locations.
- Allows the user to update the amount of that coffee in stock at a specific location.
- Allows the user to add a new location to the inventory system.
