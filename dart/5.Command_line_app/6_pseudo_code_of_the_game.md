# _Pseudo code_ for the game

As we have been doing, let's write what we need to do in a colloquial way according to the requirements:

```dart
void main() {
    print('Hello world!');


    //  Pseudo code
    //  
    //  As long as it is true
    // Show the prompt to the user
    // Read your response from the console
    // If the input is valid ('r', 'p', 's')
    // Execute computer random option
    // Compare that move with the user's move
    // Show the result
    // If input is 'q
    // Exit program
    // If the input is another key
    // Show 'Invalid input'
}
```
