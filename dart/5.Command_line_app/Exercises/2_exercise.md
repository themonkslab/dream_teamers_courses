# Exercise 2

In section 5 we created a command line application for the classic game 'Rock, Paper, Scissors'.
In this exercise the challenge is to improve the game by adding two new options: 'Lizard, Spock'.
The additional characters were added by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla before being adopted, reordered, and overpopularised by The Big Bang Theory.
Lizard and Spock reduce the chance of a tie by eating, smashing, poisoning or vaporising their opponents, as is their birthright.

## The rules

Scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. Rock crushes scissors.
