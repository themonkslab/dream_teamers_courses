# Exercise 3

You are a detective investigating a case involving a group of thieves who have stolen a priceless diamond. The thieves have hidden the diamond in one of five possible safes, but you don't know which one. You have to write a program to help you figure out which safe contains the diamond. To do this, you will have to ask for the user's input, check the input against a set of rules, and use a combination of loops, conditions, and other programming constructs to find the correct safe.

## Requirements

- Your program should ask the user to enter a number between 1 and 5, corresponding to one of the five safes.
- The user should have a random number of attempts between 1 and 5.
- After two unsuccessful attempts the diamond should change from one safe to another.
- If the user enters a number outside the range of 1 to 5, the program should print an error message and ask for input again.
- If the user enters a number corresponding to a safe that does not contain the diamond, the program should print a message indicating that the safe is empty and ask for input again.
- If the user enters a number corresponding to the safe that contains the diamond, the program should print a message indicating that the diamond has been found and ask the user to play again or not.
- If the user fails to find the diamond the program should print a message indicating that the diamond has not been found and ask the user to play again or not.
- The program should use a combination of loops (while, for), conditions (if, switch), and other programming constructs (break, continue, enums, type conversions, logic operators) to accomplish the task.
