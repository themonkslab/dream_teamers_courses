# Introduction

@Mau Di Bert

We believe that if you are here, it is because you are interested in becoming a professional at the level required to work in the United States and Europe.

To achieve this, we've prepared a learning path that is thought out from the back to the front: __you're going to learn how to test first__, so that writing high-quality code becomes an extension of your body and you can __devote time to the most fun thing, creating__.

Most likely, you're also here because you're interested in learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and you're in the right place: to learn any _Framework_ (a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development), it's essential to understand in depth the language in which it is built, and that is why our first step in learning Flutter is to learn Dart.

## Community

Before you continue, [join our free community on Discord here](https://discord.gg/vpPVf7guPC). You will find a beautiful group of people passionate about learning and growing in this world. You can introduce yourself, ask questions, learn while helping others with theirs and have fun with like-minded individuals!

## Some recommendations

Don't be afraid to __take as much time as you need to understand__: better slow but safe. Go back to previous lessons, repeat the exercises and try to learn as if you were going to teach it.

Don't just copy and paste __code__, instead __write it yourself__. It’s amazing what happens when to write it, we have to understand it and it’s the best way to __acquire best practices__ which would be the way that's conventionally considered best by the community..

Try to read everything from the beginning and calmly: articles, code, error messages. Also, you will find many terms in _italics_ right here: we recommend that you organize __your own glossary of these terms__ that will help you to fix these concepts.

You will notice that much of the time, we don't delve into certain concepts or explanations but don't worry, that will come later. We do this so that you can move forward, learning enough to create and not get frustrated!

You will __learn by doing__, so try to do the proposed alternative exercises and create new ones and then share them with others on our Discord.

## Answering your questions

If there's something you don't understand, follow this [guide]() to try to answer it to yourself first (a skill that every programmer should master) and if you can't, don't hesitate to ask, respectfully and intelligently, in our Discord channel.
