# Introduction

## Transparency note

It tends to happen __when we consume some kind of content__ from which we expect to learn something, that __we tend to put the people who produce it in a place of unquestioned wisdom__. __Or__ that at least, __is what I used to do__.

With this attitude __the only thing I achieved__ was to become less objective about what I was consuming, I was generating a kind of distance with whoever was producing the content and finally, __it planted some more insecurity in my__ developer self.

__It took me a long time__ and many talks with friends who are super cracks in the subject, __to understand that we all__, but absolutely all, __are__ in this infinite and endless world of knowledge, __to keep on learning__. They showed me that there is no such thing as a dumb question. That, as long as we ask with respect, affection and having tried to answer it before, it is a pleasure for those who are already there to help us to provide that knowledge. And that you learn in a deep and much more fun way, if it is with others.

All __this to tell you__ from the bottom of my heart, __that there are still many days when I feel that I know nothing__, that I did not have the opportunity to go step by step in an organized way, to have people dedicated to solve my doubts at each stage of the road __and that I missed many things that I would like not to miss__. However, I want you to know that I am doing my best in this project that I am writing and developing with friends, that I intend to go one step at a time and that both, you and us, are going to have the pleasure of learning in a rich and deep way!

And finally that I have been programming in Flutter for several years now and many of the things I present to you are going to have different and surely better solutions but that __I trust in the community we are building__, in you and us, __to improve ourselves all the time__, improving these pages and improving every gesture we undertake.

Encourage yourselves to ask questions, to doubt and to propose. And __know that no matter how lost you feel, if you insist and persevere, that insecurity will become smaller and smaller every day__ and what is even better, you will start to feel that you will always have much more to learn!

__We are here to make this journey together__.

## Now, the introduction

We believe that if you are here, it is because you are interested in becoming a professional at the level required to work in the United States and Europe.

To achieve this, we've prepared a learning path that is thought out from the back to the front: __you're going to learn how to test first__, so that writing high-quality code becomes an extension of your body and you can __devote time to the most fun thing, creating__.

Most likely, you're also here because you're interested in learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and you're in the right place: to learn any _Framework_ (a tool that provides ready-made components or solutions that are customized in order to speed up development), it's essential to understand in depth the language in which it is built, and that is why our first step in learning Flutter is to learn Dart.

## Community

Before you continue, [join our free community on Discord here](https://discord.gg/vpPVf7guPC). You will find a beautiful group of people passionate about learning and growing in this world. You can introduce yourself, ask questions, learn while helping others with theirs and have fun with like-minded individuals!

## Some recommendations

Don't be afraid to __take as much time as you need to understand__: better slow but safe. Go back to previous lessons, repeat the exercises and try to learn as if you were going to teach it.

Don't just copy and paste __code__, instead __write it yourself__. Itâ€™s amazing what happens when to write it, we have to understand it and itâ€™s the best way to __acquire best practices__ which would be the way that's conventionally considered best by the community..

Try to read everything from the beginning and calmly: articles, code, error messages. Also, you will find many terms in _italics_ right here: we recommend that you organize __your own glossary of these terms__ that will help you to fix these concepts.

You will notice that much of the time, we don't delve into certain concepts or explanations but don't worry, that will come later. We do this so that you can move forward, learning enough to create and not get frustrated!

You will __learn by doing__, so try to do the proposed alternative exercises and create new ones and then share them with others on our Discord.

## Answering your questions

__If there is something you don't understand__, follow [this guide]() to try to answer it to yourself first (a skill that every programmer should master) and if you can't, come to the Discord and one of us will be there to give you a hand or at least, suffer together! ðŸ¤£

And I remind you again cause it's never enough: although we are taught from an early age that being wrong is not right: __there is no such thing as a mistake if we try to learn from it and there is no such thing as a stupid question__.
