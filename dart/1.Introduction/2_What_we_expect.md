# What we expect

In this course we hope to introduce you to programming but also to a different way of doing things, thinking about their consequences and building from them.

We expect it will be the first step of the school we dream of, one that opens the doors to anyone who wants to learn, that stimulates those who don't, and that connects the professional environment with learning. A way of learning, teaching and living that gets us used to giving before receiving, that teaches us ways of expressing ourselves, of communicating.

We hope it will be a place to allow us to be who we are and even more, who we imagine we want to be.
